## Architecture Guidelines

### Project Structure
```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/           # Core app configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ models/         # Data models
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ providers/      # State management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ screens/        # UI screens
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/       # Business logic and APIs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/        # Reusable UI components
```

### Key Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep business logic separate from UI
- **State Management**: Use Riverpod for state management
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling
- **Performance**: Optimize for memory and CPU usage
- **Security**: Follow security best practices
- **Accessibility**: Ensure accessibility compliance

## AI Development Guidelines

### AI Service Integration
- Use the existing `AIService` class for AI operations
- Implement proper error handling for API calls
- Consider rate limiting and cost optimization
- Test with different AI models and providers

### Agent Development
- Follow the `AITask` model for new agent capabilities
- Implement proper progress tracking
- Handle edge cases and failures gracefully
- Document agent capabilities and limitations

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
flutter test
```

### Integration Tests
```bash
flutter test integration_test/
```

### Manual Testing
- Test on multiple platforms
- Verify AI features work correctly
- Check performance and memory usage
- Test accessibility features

## Security Considerations

- **API Keys**: Never commit API keys to the repository
- **User Data**: Handle user data securely and privately
- **Network**: Use HTTPS for all network communications
- **Storage**: Encrypt sensitive data in local storage
- **Permissions**: Request minimal necessary permissions

## Performance Guidelines

- **Memory**: Monitor memory usage, especially with multiple tabs
- **CPU**: Optimize heavy operations, use background processing
- **Network**: Implement caching and request optimization
- **Battery**: Minimize battery drain on mobile devices
- **Startup**: Keep app startup time under 3 seconds
